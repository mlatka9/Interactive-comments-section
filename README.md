## Overview

The backend application, which takes care of serving data and saving it to the database, can be found at this [link](https://github.com/mlatka9/Interactive-comments-section-backend)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **data is stored on the server so that it is not lost when the browser is refreshed**

## How to run an application locally

First make sure that the backend application has been downloaded and started correctly. You can then download the fronted application using `git clone` command. Then you need to go to the root directory. In terminal type `npm install` to get dependencies and `npm start` to run application.
